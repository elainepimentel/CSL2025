This  demonstrates that our games and systems provide a more precise control over the resources appearing {\em negatively} in sequents, unlocking new opportunities for analyzing the problem of {\em comparing proofs}.

For instance, we anticipate that studying the costs of proofs in labelled calculi could reveal connections between labels and computational bounds~\cite{DBLP:journals/jfp/AccattoliGK20}.

Moreover, it would be interesting to explore the relationship between budgets and the complexity of the cut-elimination process, particularly within the multiplicative-(sub)exponential fragment~\cite{DBLP:journals/tcs/Strassburger03,DBLP:journals/tocl/StrassburgerG11}.

Finally, we aim to investigate how the dialogue games we have developed relate to the so-called {\em concurrent games}~\cite{DBLP:conf/lics/AbramskyM99, DBLP:conf/lics/FaggianM05,DBLP:journals/lmcs/CastellanCRW17}. 


Regardless of the chosen approach to enable cut-admissibility, the need for compositionality in dialogue games driven by a cut rule is a topic worth exploring~\cite{dutilh18}.
