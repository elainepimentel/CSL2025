This work opens up several promising directions for future exploration.

In terms of variations on the present work, it would be interesting to explore extensions of \PNL\ that relax symmetry assumptions, enabling the representation of scenarios where an agent $a$ can influence the opinion of agent $b$, but not vice versa. Another potential direction involves incorporating the concept of a ``budget,'' as introduced in the game discussed in the first part of this paper~\cite{DBLP:conf/tableaux/LangOPF19}, to model situations where proponents and opponents operate under a limited amount of political capital. In such scenarios, adding or modifying relationships could reduce this capital.

To formalize this idea, preferences for minimizing the expenditure of political capital could be expressed through a combination of \PNL\ with a suitable choice logic -- a framework where preferences are explicitly definable at the object level. Semantic games for choice logics have been explored in~\cite{Freiman2023TruthLogic}, and the extension of game-induced choice logic (\textbf{GCL}) to a provability game and proof system was proposed in~\cite{Freiman2023}. 
%Investigating these integrations offers a compelling avenue for further research.

Another particularly interesting avenue is extending the semantic-provability-proof system approach to other logics characterized by Kripke semantics. For instance, it would be worthwhile to investigate games for logics that involve model-change modalities~\cite{DBLP:journals/logcom/Velazquez-Quesada17,DBLP:journals/igpl/PerrotinV21} or dynamic modalities~\cite{DBLP:journals/synthese/BenthemGL08}. Initial progress in this direction was made in~\cite{LPAR2024:Reasoning_About_Group_Polarization}, where we showed how the global link-adding and local link-changing modalities from~\cite{DBLP:journals/logcom/PedersenSA21} (inspired by sabotage modal logic~\cite{DBLP:journals/igpl/ArecesFH15,DBLP:journals/logcom/AucherBG18,DBLP:journals/logcom/BenthemLSY23}) can be incorporated into our framework.

This extension is motivated by the study of social learning and opinion dynamics, which aim to understand how specific social factors influence the acceptance or rejection of opinions. Such models can provide insights into scenarios like consensus, polarization, and fragmentation. In these contexts, positive and negative relationships between agents are not fixed; they evolve over time. For example, enemies may reconcile, new friendships or agreements may form, or agents may develop disagreements. Exploring these dynamics within our framework offers a compelling direction for future research. 

Finally, we would like very much to investigate the availability of using this framework to propose games to constructive/intuitionistic modal logics. In particular, for the constructive logic $\CK$~\cite{DBLP:conf/eumas/AcclavioC23}
