We now turn to the study of modalities in the classical setting, focusing specifically on the positive-negative modal logic \PNL\ with nominals \cite{DBLP:journals/jolli/XiongA20,DBLP:journals/logcom/PedersenSA21}. This logic is defined over Kripke frames with two disjoint and symmetric reachability relations. We will briefly demonstrate how to construct an adequate semantic game for \PNL, transform it into a provability game, and ultimately derive a corresponding sequent system. We then end with some discussion.
