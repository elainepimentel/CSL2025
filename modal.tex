We pass now to the study of modalities in the classical setting. More specifically we  focus on the positive negative modal logic \PNL\ with nominals
\cite{DBLP:journals/jolli/XiongA20,DBLP:journals/logcom/PedersenSA21}, which refers to Kripke frames with two
types of disjoint and symmetric reachability relations.We will show how to get an adequate semantic
game  for \PNL, then transforming it into a provability
game and finally deriving a sequent system.
